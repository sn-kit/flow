# AI surface availability

> Generated from `config/ai-contracts.yaml`; do not hand-edit counts or targeting.

This is the runtime availability inventory for **flonat-research**. Inclusion in this
distribution and client compatibility are separate decisions: every shipped asset
has an explicit client list, with no implicit `both` default.

## MCP registrations and CLIs

This downstream framework does not install credentials or private MCP registrations.
MCP servers are optional client adapters and are documented separately. Skills that
need an external capability must name a portable CLI or a clearly documented manual
fallback; installing the framework does not silently install those third-party services.

| Integration | Kind | Install state | Claude | Codex | Fallback |
|---|---|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| `council-api` | package and CLI | bundled source; separate uv install | Yes | Yes | use the current client or one explicitly chosen reviewer |
| `notion-mcp` | MCP registration | optional Claude adapter | Yes | No | local context files, a separate CLI, or the provider UI |
| `personal-library-cli` | CLI or network service | optional external or access-controlled | Yes | Yes | validate the project bibliography directly |
| `provider-model-clis` | CLI | optional external | Yes | Yes | current client only |
| `scholarly-compatible-cli` | CLI | optional external | Yes | Yes | web search plus manual DOI verification |

## Withheld for portability

These canonical assets are intentionally not shipped by this product. They depend
on an upstream private control plane or an unbundled runtime; an installer check
must not present them as available.

| Surface | Asset | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| skills | `audit-paper-book` | Requires the private Atlas book and research-root control plane. |
| skills | `audit-project-research` | Requires private portfolio, history, and template scripts. |
| skills | `bib-validate` | Requires the private Paperpile canonicalisation script. |
| skills | `gather-readings` | Requires the private Paperpile PDF mirror and registry. |
| skills | `init-paper-book` | Requires private Atlas book services and registration scripts. |
| skills | `init-project-research` | Requires private Atlas, Overleaf, template, and Git-hook infrastructure. |
| skills | `literature` | Pipeline mode requires the private Atlas and council/search toolchain. |
| skills | `meetings-verify` | Requires the private meeting-transcription package installation. |
| skills | `memory-cleanup` | Requires the private ai-context memory engine and store. |
| skills | `preprint` | Requires a private Overleaf registry and template checkout. |
| skills | `preregister` | Requires private Atlas topic metadata. |
| skills | `rename-project-research` | Requires private Atlas and Task Management registries. |
| skills | `save-context` | Writes to the private Task Management context library. |
| skills | `session-close` | Requires private memory sync, portfolio, and paper-history scripts. |
| skills | `skill-health` | Requires private invocation logs and health-analysis scripts. |
| skills | `system-audit` | Audits the private control plane with unbundled deterministic scripts. |

## Interpreting an unavailable entry

`No` means the distribution deliberately does not install that asset for the client.
It is not a discovery failure. Use the stated fallback, adapt the canonical source and
contract, or run a different shipped workflow; do not copy files between client homes.
