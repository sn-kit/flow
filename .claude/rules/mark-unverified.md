# Rule: Mark Unverified Claims

## Principle

**Never assert a citation, statistic, venue policy, or factual claim that hasn't been verified from a primary source.** Mark anything unverified as `[UNVERIFIED]` rather than asserting it. The user reads outputs critically and catches false claims, but the cost of catching them is real — and false claims that slip through (especially in submitted papers, grant applications, or briefings to collaborators) damage credibility.

## What "unverified" means

A claim is unverified when:

- The citation key, DOI, or paper title has NOT been confirmed against Crossref / Semantic Scholar / OpenAlex / Paperpile
- The venue policy (page limit, double-blind status, formatting rule, deadline) has NOT been read from the official CFP
- The statistic has NOT been computed from a known data source or quoted from a paper just read
- The author affiliation, journal impact factor, or institutional fact has NOT been checked against a structured source
- A **self-authored mathematical result** — a comparative static (∂/∂x sign), a monotonicity or limit claim, existence of a threshold, a closed form — has NOT been actually derived or checked (solving the recurrence, taking the derivative, evaluating the limit), but only asserted from intuition

## What to do instead

| Instead of | Write |
|---|---|
| "EAAMO is double-blind" | "EAAMO is `[UNVERIFIED — check 2026 CFP]` likely double-blind" |
| "Smith (2024) showed X" | "Smith (2024) `[UNVERIFIED]` reportedly showed X" |
| "ICML 2026 page limit is 9 pages" | "ICML 2026 page limit `[UNVERIFIED — last seen 8pp main + refs in 2025]`" |
| "so `$\partial C/\partial\lambda < 0$` and a threshold `$\lambda^\star$` arises" | derive it first (solve the recurrence, sign the derivative); if not done, `[UNVERIFIED]` / state as conjecture |

The `[UNVERIFIED]` flag is preserved through edits until the user or a sub-agent runs verification (e.g., `bib-validate --verify-doi`, reading the official CFP, or querying a structured source).

## An `[UNVERIFIED]` flag must carry its dossier

A bare flag ("Pizer & Yang `[UNVERIFIED — run literature]`") pushes the entire search cost onto the user, who resolves these manually. Every `[UNVERIFIED]` reference or claim — in files (atlas Suggested Readings, `.paperpile-import` UNRESOLVED blocks, notes) AND in chat output — must carry **all metadata currently on hand**:

- Full title, or an explicit "title unknown"
- Authors, year, venue as far as known
- Any ids (DOI, arXiv, SSRN) — ids recalled from memory are **included and flagged** `[UNVERIFIED id, from memory]`, never omitted
- Provenance: where the reference/claim came from (which scope note, scan, or memory)
- Searches already attempted, with date, so they aren't repeated
- A concrete search hint (exact query strings, id lookups, series names)

Format: best-known bibliographic line → provenance → searches tried (dated) → search hint(s). Trigger incident: 2026-07-23, atlas Suggested Readings verification pass — "you never give out the full info you have currently so I could efficiently search for it, that's a problem all the time."

## Self-authored mathematical results

A derived claim you *write into a paper* is subject to this rule exactly as a citation is. A comparative static, monotonicity/limit claim, threshold-existence claim, or closed form counts as **unverified until you have actually derived or checked it** — solved the recurrence, taken the derivative, evaluated the limit — not merely asserted it from intuition. **Clean LaTeX compilation is not verification** (it checks syntax, not truth), and neither is user approval of the prose. Until checked, mark `[UNVERIFIED]` or state the result explicitly as a conjecture. Watch in particular the **transient-vs-stationary conflation**: a learning/adjustment *rate* governs how fast a system reaches its fixed point, not where the fixed point is — so if the rate is meant to be the operative variable, the quantity must be evaluated on a finite horizon, not at the stationary limit. This is `mark-unverified` applied to your own mathematics, and the write-time complement to `paper-code-consistency.md` (which is review-time and code-focused). Trigger incident: `2026-07-03` paper-philtech Appendix A shipped "$C(\lambda)$ decreasing in $\lambda$" when the stationary $v^\infty=\phi(e)$ is $\lambda$-independent (caught by `review-cluster`).

## Self-produced measurements

The empirical sibling of the section above. A number **you generated** — a benchmark, a peak-memory figure, a timing, a recall score, a cache hit-rate — is a claim about the world and is **unverified until it has reproduced**. A single run is an observation, not a measurement, and a recommendation built on one is a guess wearing a number.

Before a self-produced number justifies an action:

1. **Reproduce it**, ideally with a *different instrument*. Agreement between two methods is the evidence; a second run of the same flawed harness only repeats the flaw.
2. **Sanity-check the magnitude** against something independent. A figure that implies an impossible ratio (a 100 MB input producing a 7 GB peak; a component at 4% of the total you were about to optimise) is a signal the harness is wrong, not a finding.
3. **State the instrument** when reporting, because it bounds the claim: `/usr/bin/time -l` max RSS, in-process `ru_maxrss`, `docker stats` (**includes page cache**), 60-second forensic sampling (**misses short peaks**). These do not measure the same thing and routinely disagree.
4. **Prefer the mechanism to the number.** "Peak is inside `sherpa_onnx.process()`" survives a bad measurement; "peak is 2,443 MB" does not.

When a number cannot be reproduced, **say so and stop** — do not average the disagreeing runs, do not pick the convenient one, and do not proceed to a fix. Mark it `[UNVERIFIED]` and act only on whatever independent evidence exists.

Trigger incident: `2026-07-25` meeting-transcribe memory investigation. Three consecutive recommendations — chunk a 4 GB audio buffer, add a duration guard, set `num_threads=1` — were each refuted by the next measurement (the buffer was 4.2% of peak; peak was flat across a 4× duration range; `num_threads=1` halved memory at 7 min and *increased* it at 28 min). Four instruments disagreed on the same workload. See [`log/incidents/2026-07-25_measurement-discipline.md`](../log/incidents/2026-07-25_measurement-discipline.md).

## Sibling: claim-strength drift during revision

This rule covers claims that were never verified. Its revision-time sibling is the **claim-strength ladder** ([`docs/reference/claim-strength-ladder.md`](../docs/reference/claim-strength-ladder.md)): an already-verified claim must not silently move up or down the epistemic-strength scale (*is consistent with < associated < predicts < causes*) during a rewrite — including by hedge deletion — without an authorizing revision-plan item. The deterministic complement `.scripts/check_token_conservation.py` verifies numeric/citation/protected-term tokens survive a revision unchanged. (Ported from academic-research-skills v3.19, 2026-07-24.)

## When This Applies

- Drafting paper sections, abstracts, response letters, grant applications
- Producing literature notes, syntheses, reading lists
- Writing about venue specs (page limits, formats, deadlines, review styles)
- Reporting statistics or findings from prior work
- Generating citation lists from memory

## When to Skip

- The user explicitly says "draft fast, I'll verify later"
- Internal notes / brainstorming where verification would slow ideation
- Code comments documenting what the code does (not a factual claim about the world)

## Verification chains

Where the verification should come from, by claim type:

| Claim type | Primary source |
|---|---|
| Citation existence | `paperpile search-library` or `scholarly scholarly-verify-dois` |
| DOI resolution | Crossref API |
| Venue page limit / format | Official CFP page; never WikiCFP alone |
| Venue review style (single/double-blind) | Official CFP |
| Statistic from a paper | The paper PDF, current session-readable |
| Author affiliation | Author's institutional page or ORCID |
| Journal impact factor | **JCR / Clarivate only** — see [`venue-metrics.md`](venue-metrics.md). **Not OpenAlex**: `summary_stats.2yr_mean_citedness` is a different metric and returns near-zero values when OpenAlex mis-matches the source. If JCR is unavailable, leave the field empty and record SJR from the local SCImago snapshot instead |
| Journal SJR / quartile / h-index | `scripts/venue-rankings-lookup.py` — local snapshots, no web call |

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't** invent a citation key like "smith2024gaming" because it's plausible — that's a fabrication.
- **Don't** assert a venue policy from training data — venue rules change yearly. Read the CFP.
- **Don't** quote a paper from memory without re-checking the actual claim. Hallucinated quotes are a top failure mode.
- **Don't** strip `[UNVERIFIED]` flags during editing without actually verifying. The flag is the trail of unfinished work.

## Trigger incidents

This rule was promoted to a global rule on 2026-05-10 after recurring incidents:
- Phantom citation numbers in literature notes
- Fabricated "double-blind option" claim about a venue
- Hallucinated bib entries that wasted a verification cycle

## Failure modes prevented

- **F1** fabricated citation — see [`docs/reference/failure-modes.md`](../docs/reference/failure-modes.md)
- **F2** hallucinated venue policy — see [`docs/reference/failure-modes.md`](../docs/reference/failure-modes.md)
- **F3** phantom quote from memory — see [`docs/reference/failure-modes.md`](../docs/reference/failure-modes.md)
- **F4** invented bib key — see [`docs/reference/failure-modes.md`](../docs/reference/failure-modes.md)
- **F6** stripped `[UNVERIFIED]` flag — see [`docs/reference/failure-modes.md`](../docs/reference/failure-modes.md)
- **F10** single-run measurement drove a recommendation — a self-produced number acted on before it reproduced, or reported without naming the instrument (2026-07-25 meeting-transcribe: three successive fixes each refuted by the next measurement)
